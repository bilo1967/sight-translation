# sight-translation - Simultaneous Interpretation Scroller  
A web-based tool didactic tool for trainers and students of simultaneous interpretation, designed to practice and objectively evaluate sight translation performance. It simulates real-time speech flow by scrolling text at customizable speeds (WPM), offering objective performance tracking and adaptive display settings. 
Users load or paste text, adjust scrolling speed (in words-per-minute), and customize readability (font size, spacing) during exercises. Real-time metrics (elapsed/remaining time) and pause functionality are included.  

## Key Features  
- **Controlled Scrolling**: Adjust speed in *words-per-minute (WPM)* to mimic speech pacing.  
- **Real-Time Metrics**:  
  - Elapsed/remaining time (objective, clock-based).  
  - Pause/resume functionality.  
- **Display Customization**: Modify font size and line spacing, and text scrolling rate *during* exercises.  
- **Text Preparation**: Format raw text via TinyMCE (bold, headings, etc.) before scrolling.  

## Use Cases  
- **Didactics**: Trainers evaluate students under standardized conditions (same text/WPM, independently from windows size and screen resolution).  
- **Self-Training**: Interpreters practice pacing and adaptability.  
- **Assessment**: Objective benchmarks for speed/accuracy in interpretation exams.  

## Setup  
1. Clone the repo:
