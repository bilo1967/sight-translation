# sight-translation - A Scroller App for Simultaneous Interpreting Training  

**Scroller** is a web-based tool for trainers and students in simultaneous interpretation, designed to practice and objectively evaluate sight translation performance. It simulates real-time speech flow by scrolling text at customizable speeds (measured in *Words Per Minute - WPM*), offering objective performance tracking and adaptive display settings.  

Developed for the [Department of Interpretation and Translation (DIT)](https://dit.unibo.it/) at the University of Bologna by **Gabriele Carioli**.  

**Live Demo**: [scroller.ditlab.it](https://scroller.ditlab.it/)
